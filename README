= Description

VimMate is a graphical add-on to Vim with IDE-like features: it does more
than the plain Vim while still being lightweight. Even with the additional
features, it stays out of the way for it's main task: editing files with Vim.
VimMate adds functionality to Vim by embedding Vim GTK GUI (gVim) within
VimMate.

Some of the ideas of VimMate comes from PIDA[http://pida.berlios.de/]
and others from TextMate[http://macromates.com/] (although I've never
used TextMate).

VimMate's homepage: http://vimmate.rubyforge.org

= Features

VimMate has the following features:
- Uses Vim[http://www.vim.org/] for the text editor so it has all of
  Vim's qualities.
- Written in Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org/] so the code is nice and clean.
- Integrated, hideable and searchable file tree with filter for easy
  project viewing.
- Multiple integrated terminals <i>(Optional)</i>.
- Basic Subversion[http://subversion.tigris.org/] integration: <i>(Optional)</i>
  - The file status is displayed in the file tree.
  - You can add, rename, delete and revert a file from the file tree.
- Navigate the various part of the interface with the keyboard

= Installation
VimMate has only been tested under Linux (in fact,
{Gentoo Linux}[http://www.gentoo.org/]). It might work under other OSs,
although I do not know. I think only the file list will work under
Windows because Vim does not use GTK under Windows so it cannot be embedded.
I know nothing about MacOSX so I cannot say if it works or not.

To install:
- Make sure Vim[http://www.vim.org/] is installed and compiled with the
  graphical interface. Try running +gvim+ to see if it works. Only Vim
  version 7.0 has been tested.
- Make sure Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org/] version 1.8 or more is installed.
  Try running <tt>ruby --version</tt> in a terminal.
- Install the Ruby bindings to GTK and GNOME (for the VTE terminal). See
  {Ruby-GNOME2 website}[http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/]. Only
  Ruby-GNOME2 version 0.15 and 0.16 has been tested. You don't need VTE: if
  it's not installed, VimMate will not have terminals but will run anyway.
- If you want to use the Subversion integration feature, you must install
  the subversion bindings for Ruby. Check if it's available for your OS
  or get the sources from
  {Subversion's website}[http://subversion.tigris.org/] and compile them.
- Download the latest VimMate on
  {VimMate's homepage}[http://vimmate.rubyforge.org/].
- You now have 3 choices to install VimMate: manually, with Ruby Gems or with
  <tt>setup.rb</tt>:
  - With Ruby Gems from GemCutter
    - Simply run <tt>gem install vimmate --source http://gemcutter.org</tt> .
  - Build the gem by yourself
    - Simply run <tt>rake install</tt>
  - Manually
    - Copy the file <tt>bin/vimmate</tt> and the directory
      <tt>lib/vimmatelib</tt> to a directory somewhere in your path.
    - Make sure +vimmate+ is executable: <tt>chmod u+x vimmate</tt>
- cd to a directory where your project is. (Watch out for directories
  with too many files. See <i>Limitations</i> below.)
- Run +vimmate+

Run <tt>vimmate --help</tt> for more information.

= Configuration
Note that you don't have to do what's described in this section:
everything will work anyway. It's just filled with nice tricks.

VimMate doesn't need any special configuration to run. But, when VimMate is
first run, it creates a file named <tt>.vimmaterc</tt> in your HOME directory.
You can edit this file at your own risk. If anything goes wrong, you can
always delete this file and it will be recreated with the default
configuration.

Most variables are self explanatory. One variable deserves a special
explanation because it can be useful to change. It's the line that
starts with <tt>:terminals_autoexec:</tt>. This line specifies a string
that is automatically executed by every terminals that are created by
VimMate. I'm sure you can think about a way to use this, but the idea
of this configuration line is to initialize the terminal so that it can
execute Vim (the console <tt>vim</tt>) without weird warnings about
escape characters. Here is how to configure it so that it works without
warnings with the bash shell:

 # Other configurations before...
 # (Because of a small quirk in rdoc, I put a space between the
 #  colon (:) and terminals_autoexec but there must be no space.)
 : terminals_autoexec: |
  export TERM="gnome"
  clear
   
 # Other configurations after...

You can adapt those commands for your shell. If you wonder about the
syntax of this file, it's a Ruby hash with Ruby symbols as keys dumped
with YAML[http://www.yaml.org/].

If you have problems getting it to work, watch out for whitespace because
YAML is whitespace sensitive (like python). If you still can't get it to
work, try running this in a shell:

 ruby -ryaml -e 'puts({:terminals_autoexec => %{export TERM="gnome"\nclear}}.to_yaml)'

You can redirect the output of this command to overwrite your .vimmaterc file
and then run VimMate: it should work this time.

An other nice trick is to add a special alias that exists only within
VimMate's terminals (Thanks to Jonathan Hankins for this updated tip,
see {#13432}[http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=13432&group_id=2612&atid=10058]
for details):

 # Other configurations before...
 # (Because of a small quirk in rdoc, I put a space between the
 #  colon (:) and terminals_autoexec but there must be no space.)
 : terminals_autoexec: |
   alias vm='gvim --servername $(gvim --serverlist | grep "VIMMATE_$PPID") --remote-tab'
   export TERM="gnome"
   clear
   
 # Other configurations after...

Again, you have to adapt for your shell because this is for bash. This
will also only works if you have only one VimMate running. This will allow
you to type

 vm a_file

to edit <tt>a_file</tt> with the running VimMate. This can be handy for those
who prefer the command line to the file tree.

If you use Subversion (SVN), you can add yet an other line to be able to
edit your commit messages within VimMate:

 # Other configurations before...
 # (Because of a small quirk in rdoc, I put a space between the
 #  colon (:) and terminals_autoexec but there must be no space.)
 : terminals_autoexec: |
   alias vm='gvim --servername $(gvim --serverlist | grep "VIMMATE_$PPID") --remote-tab'
   export SVN_EDITOR='gvim --servername `gvim --serverlist | grep VIMMATE_` --remote-wait'
   export TERM="gnome"
   clear
   
 # Other configurations after...

Then, when you run:

 svn commit

the commit message will be edited within VimMate and Subversion will wait for
the buffer containing the file to be deleted with the command

 :bd

within Vim.

= Interesting Vim scripts
Here are some of the Vim scripts that I think are useful with VimMate to
make Vim more powerful:
- matchit[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39]:
  Extends the Vim command <tt>%</tt> to easily navigate in
  matching language constructs for many languages.
- rails[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1567]:
  Easy navigation for {Ruby on Rails}[http://www.rubyonrails.org/]
- grep[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=311]:
  Nice grep integration. I frequently use the command <tt>:Rgrep</tt>.
- dbext[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=356]:
  Database access within Vim. Integrates well with <tt>rails.vim</tt>.
- SimpleFold[http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?simplefold+plugin+0.4.0]:
  Nicely folds classes and methods for easy navigation.
- snippetsEmu[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1318]:
  TextMate-like snippet expansion.
- vcscommand[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90]:
  Integration for CVS and Subversion (SVN). Supports lots of things like
  viewing the version control system log, integrated Vim diff, etc.
- surround[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697]:
  A nice script to add, change or remove "surroundings", like
  parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML tags...
- ruby-block-conv[http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?Ruby+block+conversion+macros+for+Vim]:
  Convert single line blocks from {} into do/end and the other way around.

There are a lot of other nice script out there so check
{Vim's web site}[http://www.vim.org/] for more scripts.

= Keyboard shortcuts
Here is a list of the various shortcut keys:
- CTRL+SHIFT+S: Set focus to current terminal (shell)
- CTRL+SHIFT+T: Create a new terminal
- CTRL+SHIFT+W: Close current terminal
- CTRL+PAGEDOWN: Next terminal
- CTRL+PAGEDOWN: Previous terminal
- CTRL+SHIFT+L: Set focus to file filter
- CTRL+SHIFT+F: Set focus to file list
- CTRL+SHIFT+E: Set focus to search file list
- CTRL+SHIFT+V: Set focus to Vim
Thanks to Florian Frank who sent me a patch for the first 5 shortcuts. The
other shortcuts where also added thanks to this patch by Florian Frank. (Note
that if there are bugs in the processing of those shortcut keys, it's probably
my fault and not is.)

= Limitations
- VimMate cannot handle well a directory tree with thousands of files,
  although it has no problems with hundreds of files although it can take
  some time to start.
- Vim loads after VimMate is started. If you close VimMate or open a file
  before Vim starts and is connected to VimMate, this can lead to weird
  things. You should wait for Vim before you start playing with VimMate.
  Weird things can also happen if you close VimMate without saving in
  Vim before.
- Setting the focus to Vim with the shortcut key doesn't work perfectly. If it
  doesn't seem to work, you can try to press TAB or the Up or Down keys on
  your keyboard after using the shortcut key and it works most of the time.
